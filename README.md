# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple, responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Play as X or O against a friend in the browser. The game features a clean UI, color-coded turns, winner/draw detection, and a reset button. Great for learning basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design!
